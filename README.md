# ScratchPad
A Visual Basic application tool that integrated with FADV’s Oracle CRM ‘Siebel’. The application allowed CSRs to efficiently log tickets by incorporating templates based on different types of calls. Scratchpad’s UI enabled the FADV’s CVS i-9 Team to better capture specific details during customer calls more quickly and accurately. The data stored and received from the Scratchpad tool, increased productivity for both CSRs and Management because they now were able to faster track patterns in the calls their CSRs were receiving. 
Instead of using notepad, my application incorporates templates and a coded mechanism which simplifies our ticket logging process by condensing the process down to 3 simple buttons clicks.
