# ScratchPad
A beefed-up version of notepad that I created to allowed users on my team CVS i-9 at FADV to efficiently take, store and log tickets in FADV’s CRM tool ‘Siebel’.

Instead of using notepad, my application incorporates templates and a coded mechanism which simplifies our ticket logging process by condensing the process down to 3 simple buttons clicks.
